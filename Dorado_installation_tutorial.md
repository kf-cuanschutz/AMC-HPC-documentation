## Dorado Installation Guide

This guide is to demonstrate how to install Dorado as a module on Alpine. The module created is a personal one; unique to the user that installs it.

If there is enough demand for Dorado, it can be turned into a public module available to all Alpine users.

## Part 1: Unpacking the tarball

The first few steps follow Dorado's own installation guide found here:
*[Dorado Github](https://github.com/nanoporetech/dorado)*

Download the linux-x64 tarball from Dorado's github above and uploading it to your /projects/ directory.
Once that's done, change directories to /projects/$USER and run the following command:

<bash>
  tar -xvzf dorado-0.7.2-linux-x64.tar.gz ''  # Rename with correct tar file name if necessary
<bash>

This should create a directory called dorado-<VERSION>-linux-x64, with two subdirectories; "bin/" and "lib/".
