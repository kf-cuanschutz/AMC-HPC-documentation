# Preventative maintenance 

### When is the Preventative maintenance performed (PM)?

CU Boulder performs preventative maintenance every first Wednesday of the month.

### Where can I follow CU Boulder (PM) updates?

PM updates can be followed [here]: (https://curc.statuspage.io/).
There, you will know if Alpine is affected by the maintenance.
You can also subscribe to the page.

### Will my Alpine jobs get killed because of the PM?

It depends but usually jobs are held until after the maintenance.
However, the screen sessions usually get killed if they were launched on the login node
