Running hail on Alpine:
============================================================

This short tutorial shows you how to run hail on Alpine. Hail has been installed from this page: https://hail.is/docs/0.2/install/linux.html
Note that at the moment you have to open a ticket on Alpine so that Hail can be installed into your filesystem.
Here, we see how to run hail interactively using a script of modified from the hail website, but hail can also be run non-interactively.
The hail installation that we use for our example is located in "/pl/active/CCPM/software".
